# Project - *Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis* 

**Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis** is a program which performs simple [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) of Twitter data---that is, determining the "attitude" of tweets (how "positive" or "negative") about a particular topic. We will apply this program to **real data** taken directly from Twitter, and use your analysis to consider basic questions about people's attitudes on social media.

## Notes

This project involves working with **real, unfiltered, unsanitized data** taken directly from the Twitter "firehose"--all public tweets made. _Tweets may include offensive, inappropriate, or triggering language or content._  As with the rest of the Internet, any given moment on Twitter can reveal both the peaks and valleys of human behavior. If you are concerned about this data in any way, please let us know.

    between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). The words have
    been manually labeled by Finn Årup Nielsen in 2009-2011. The file
    is tab-separated. There are two versions:

    AFINN-111: Newest version with 2477 words and phrases.

    AFINN-96: 1468 unique words and phrases on 1480 lines. Note that there
    are 1480 lines, as some words are listed twice. The word list in not
    entirely in alphabetic ordering.  

    An evaluation of the word list is available in:


    The list was used in: 

    Lars Kai Hansen, Adam Arvidsson, Finn Årup Nielsen, Elanor Colleoni,
