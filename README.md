# Twitter's Sentiment Analysis
Social networks are a fascinating domains for applying concepts from data science and visualization. Not only are they sources of **big** "big data" (about 500 million tweets are sent on Twitter each _day_), but their status as personal communities means that they often can provide profound insights into how people think, feel, and interact. 

For this project, our team will write a program to perform simple [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) of Twitter data---that is, determining the "attitude" of tweets (how "positive" or "negative") about a particular topic. We will apply this program to **real data** taken directly from Twitter, and use your analysis to consider basic questions about people's attitudes on social media.

- This project involves working with **real, unfiltered, unsanitized data** taken directly from the Twitter "firehose"--all public tweets made. _Tweets may include offensive, inappropriate, or triggering language or content._  As with the rest of the Internet, any given moment on Twitter can reveal both the peaks and valleys of human behavior. If you are concerned about this data in any way, please let us know.

- Project Focus
1. Working with **Python**: a. data structures: lists, dictionaries, and tuples; b. using Python loops and conditionals;
2. Defining re-usable functions that take in parameters and return data;
3. Programmatically processing, filtering, and organizing textual data;
4. Interacting with **Twitter API**;
5. Analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing data with **SciPy, Pandas, Bokeh**, and **Numpy**.
